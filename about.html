    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p id="aboutPage">
        Family owned and operated since 2019 our hometown car wash features 3 wash bays with something for everyone. Our
        Touchless Automatic and Soft Touch Automatic bays offer fast and convenient car washing to get you back on the
        road faster and CLEANER without you ever needing to leave your vehicle! Just pull up and select your preferred
        wash package at the menu board, lit signs and automated doors will let you know its your turn to pull into the
        bays. Our directional signs will guide you in and let you know when to place the vehicle in park. Then just sit
        back and enjoy while the system does the "dirty work." Monthly Wash Packages are available for our automatic
        bays. <br><br>
        Like to wash your own vehicle? Our heated self-serve bay features coin or credit/debit card payment options, a
        full range of wash options and even a dryer. Vacuums are available to everyone. <br><br>
        We take pride in keeping a clean well-lit facility that's safe and available to our customers 24 hours a day. We
        also take pride in our community which is why we choose to use systems that consume less water than your
        commerical tunnel washes and use environmentally safer products. <br><br>
        Above all we take pride in the satisfaction of our customers. We truly appreciate your business. <br><br>
